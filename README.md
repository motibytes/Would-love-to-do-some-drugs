Would love to do some drugs
    To let this out 
        You know 
            What I mean 
To feel 
    To let go 
        To be real 
            for once 
                for a moment 
                    to breathe

To find out 
    And it's too big 
        how to open it 
            how to eat it 

So I will mask it 
    with Silence 
        with pain 
            with Sadness 

Drink of it 
    Spill over 
        Hate this 

Let me sink 
    Let me feel 
        He hurt me 

-

Why did you tear me down 
    Why did you shut me down
You kept me down
    I could never rise above it 
        God
There was never a level I could reach 
    not once in my life 
        that I could ever 
            rise above that feeling 
The feeling 
    of being crushed 
Of a heart and a flame 
    covered in soot
God damn 
    To me 
        I wanted everything 
The older I got 
    I could not reach as high 

Where am I now 

-

My plans failed before they started 

blamed for my bad reactions to situations
Sabotaged in progress

but I stopped 
    How will you stop me now 

You didn't Know I had the power 
    not to choose
You didn't know I could drop 
    the whole stack 
        the whole deck
But I can 
    look at me now 

I won't participate
    I let go. 
        Fuck You. 

-

Why did you carve me out like this 
    Ignorant 
        Fearful 
            Fool 

Now there is almost nothing left of me 
    Your self fulfilling prophesy 

I spent your tokens 
    I took so many as I could 
    because I knew you didn't give me enough to win 

And they told me not to blame 
If I stopped blaming, I could have been like them who did it 
Fuck Them Fuck You 
    You fucking Shut me down 
Man 

And this time I pretend like I'm winning
    but this is probably a deeper level
    of shutdown 
        The regression 
            From action 

-

You shoot me in the leg when I go 
to take the shot 

    You fucking cunt! 

God I'm weak too 
    I don't want to fail
    That crushing weight 
        of INDIFFERENCE 
You Motherfucker 
    Can only see 
        the finish 
Bury it - bury the feelings 

- 

Holy Fucking Shit 
    A Goddamn miracle for the 
Shit I did manage to do 
    Did write 
        No poetry
    Did Listen
        No song 
    I wrote 
        No fiction 
    I sang
        No song 
    
    You know 
        In videogames
            You can win 
And No Goddamn Tyrant comes 
    at the end 
        to belittle your victory
    make you never want to play again 

- 

You made me 
    I stole from you 
        I deceived you 

It hurt to try
    So I sold you instead

I never took a risk 
    I calculated all my bets

I wasn't too strong 
    but you still couldn't stop me 
    from playing the big blind

-

Now here I am 
    playing my biggest hand
        Biggest bluff
    Heist of Heights
        Bastard.
    
Sold you on giving me a chance
    Playing like I'd succeed

Fool. I'm riding your ignorance. 
    It wasn't really enough you bastard. 
    I got you in on a 25% investment, 
        I knew it took 100 to win, 

If you had any sense
    you'd know too 

You couldn't know better
    I'm evil 
        You didn't know 

- 

How can I judge you 
    Pitiful FUCK 
        You fucking Bastard. 

Hey, I just wasn't a safe player
    You know I'd shoot God
        that's just who I am 

You were protecting me
    right
How do I forgive what 
    I can't even feel 

How can I forgive you 
when I already pardon you 

God waited for me to shoot fire arrows
    the fuel went out 
He reclaimed his gifts
    my ability 

- 

I watch what I could make 
and the ability to make it 
disappear just as fast

Damn, where can I go 
    but into a hole 

You. You! You are a bold, fierce, honorable man! You are a confident charming fellow! 
Was all of this your fear of your father's shadow? 
    Shut me down first, 
        to save the fathers wrath of risk taking? 
That is what happened, isn't it? 

He taught you the lesson, 
    to never take a risk 
    And you taught it to me.
